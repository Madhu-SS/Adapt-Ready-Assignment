Since I have never used XXXX nor ever submitted any money transfer I immediately reported to XXXX via XXXX that the following transactions were fraudulent and not authorized by me. \\n\\nThose transactions were as follows : 1. Transaction ID : XXXX, Amount : {$130.00} 2. Transaction ID : XXXX ; Amount {$130.00} 3. Transaction ID : XXXX ; Amount {$170.00} Since I reported this as fraudulent at XXXX XXXX XXXX immediately I did not believe that any money would be withdrawn from my account. By XXXXXXXX XXXX I discovered that those charges were withdrawn from my bank account. I immediately notified my bank of the fraudulent activity and they processed a stop payment. Thereafter, I received several emails from XXXX reflecting that I \" owed \\'\\' a debt. I notified them on XX/XX/XXXX, that those transactions were fraudulent, but continued to received payment requests between XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. I received notice on XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX that they denied my claim based upon \" account history \\'\\' however, I requested evidence of this account history ( since I never opened a XXXX account ) and XXXX responded on XX/XX/XXXX, that XXXX could not provide details of the fraudulent transactions without a law enforcement agency. Please note, the original denial by XXXX occurred without anyone ever responding via email or phone call to discuss the facts. \\n\\nApproximately two weeks later, it was discovered that our home computer system had been hacked since the same hacker used my credit card to make payments on some account. It should be noted that because these transactions were from PayPal, they ultimately resolved these fraudulent claims in my favor because they recognized that the reason that the \" history \\'\\' appeared to be legitimate was because the hacker broke into my computer system and it appeared as if the individual were in my home THEY WERE NOT. Therefore, I filed an identify theft report on XX/XX/XXXX, with the government and I also filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. \\n\\nOnce I filed my complaint with the XXXX, the company sent responses wherein they continued to deny that the transactions were authorized and notified me that I could contact their executive offices. I did that on XX/XX/XXXX, to an individual named XXXX, wherein I provided a detailed response and evidence showing that my account had been hacked, but received no response from this. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a response from XXXX through XXXX  yet again was denying my claim since they believed it to be accurate. On XX/XX/XXXX, I provided a response via XXXX  to XXXX and directly to the executives offices to an individual named XXXX yet again explaining that the authorized transactions appeared legitimate due to a hack and not because I authorized same. I also provided evidence regarding same. On XX/XX/XXXX, I also sent a follow-up identity theft report to the XXXX offices and still received no reply. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received yet another response from XXXX via XXXX  saying they denied my claim after doing extensive research, but yet again they have never once either emailed or called me to discuss this matter, or explained how the evidence I provided does not support that the transactions were authorized by me. I also responded via XXXX  expressing my dissatisfaction with the response. \\n\\nI did not authorize these transactions since the evidence I\\'ve provided proves that a hacker gained access to my computer/home network and used the IP address that XXXX claims is \" proof \\'\\' that I authorized these transactions, when in fact that is not true. \\n\\nI am filing this claim since the identity theft website indicated that this was an appropriate next step and since this company is contending that this debt is valid and that they will notify collections since they believe same to be a valid debt. This is NOT a valid debt. If you research this company you will see that these type of fraudulent transactions happen frequently and they quickly \" deny \\'\\' the claims leaving the consumer responsible for their inept actions. Had XXXX simply not allowed the transactions not to go through when I originally notified them of this fraud, no money would have exchanged hands and this would not be a problem. However, they failed to do so. I will fight these charges through every legal means possible since I will not be held responsible for something I did not do primarily because if I do not then the individual that hacked my computer and then ultimately my PayPal account ( since I never had XXXX ) would be able to get away with this dangerous behavior. XXXX denying my claims is resulting in the perpetuation of fraud and they too must be stopped. \\n\\nI am attaching several documents which have been provided to XXXX via XXXX  and directly to their executive offices for consideration.',\n",
       "       'I have an injury committed by GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL towards me. I sent GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL , INC. a letter CERTIFIED MAIL NUMBER # XXXX on XX/XX/2022 requesting my credit balance refund Pursuant to 15 USC CH 41 1666 ( d ) also Pursuant to 12 CFR 226.11, GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL did not respond and now I am contacting the CFPB to help with the validation of debt, as GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL , INC. stated that I owe an alleged debt. I called XX/XX/XXXX to get a response as to why nothing was sent regarding the letter about the credit balance refund. I received an email on XX/XX/2022 thinking this email was regarding the response to my letter. It was not, I called on XX/XX/2022, responding to the email that was sent to me by XXXX XXXX. I called and asked about the refund, and no one was able to respond. I asked if my letter was received and I was told it was received on XX/XX/2022, and no written communication as requested has been given as of yet. I called again XX/XX/2022 and spoke to XXXX who was professional and informed me that she couldnt assist me on the number I dialed in her department that a manager would need to handle the call. She stated someone would call me back and I agreed on a 1 time phone call. I received a call back from XXXX XXXX Manager He stated he didn\\'t want the call recorded and I stated as well that I did not want the call recorded and he stated \" we do this for quality assurance \\'\\' I stated that \" I do my recording for quality assurance \\'\\' He stated he didn\\'t know me and that he doesn\\'t have to be recorded \\'\\' I stated that I didn\\'t know him and I choose to not be recorded. \\'\\' He said \" I will submit a request \\'\\' I stated \" A request? \\'\\' I do not want the call recorded period. I asked to speak to someone else who didn\\'t want to be combative, but actually move forward with the call. He stated \" it looks like you are working with an attorney so you don\\'t need to record the call \\'\\', I stated \" who informed you that I was being represented by an attorney? \\'\\' He stated well it assumes that you are based on the paperwork. \\'\\' I asked to speak to another supervisor immediately. He refused several times to get me another manager. I asked him several times for clarity, \" are you refusing to get me another supervisor? \\'\\' He said \" you can call back \\'\\' and informed him that \" I am already on the phone. I am not calling back, you can get me to another supervisor now that I am on the line already. \\'\\' Eventually he said \" ok \\'\\' put me on hold and came back and said \" no one else was available \\'\\' and asked if they could call me back I replied \" I am authorizing a one time call back, yes \\'\\'. He said ok someone will call you back. At XXXX cst I finished an email and sent it to XXXX XXXX to inform her of my encounter with her agents and questions about the refund and that no one had returned the call after her agent XXXX XXXX practices deceptive acts and misleading me attempting to make me think someone would call me back. GM financial closed at XXXX cst. XXXX didn\\'t put in a request to have someone call me back. This is unacceptable and goes against GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL values and ethics. I have yet to receive a phone call back about the matter nor has anyone responded to the email I sent to XXXX informing her agent didnt put any request in to call me back to handle the payment arrangement. Called GENERAL MOTOR FINANCIAL , INC. again on XX/XX/2022 and spoke to XXXX XXXX who didnt have any way of helping me with a response to the letter I sent in communicating the credit refund. She wanted to pass me over to another department that handles refunds in the customer service department. I asked to speak to a manager in that department. She stated she would have one give me a callback and in the meantime we would wait for a supervisor in the customer service department that helps with refunds. XXXX XXXX returned from hold stating, They had a long wait, and she submitted the request for the supervisor to call me back to talk about the assistance program. I received a call back from XXXX XXXX XXXX and informed him that I was calling pertaining to my refund ; however, I was informed by XXXX XXXX that this department could not help me. It would be best for us not to go over the refund, but lets go over the assistance program. XXXX XXXX XXXX  stated the account was in default and I stated how?, when I sent an instrument payment on XX/XX/2022 and received CERTIFIED MAIL # XXXX. He stated the payment has not been put in the system. When informing him of the payment instrument I sent in he stated and I quote XXXX we will not be entertaining this payment you sent in he laughed you know good as well that sending in that amount will do nothing for your account. This was an attempt of XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX attempting to disgrace me PURSUANT to 15 U. S. C. 1692 ( e ) ( 7 ). He also took the liberty to mention that We will discuss the contract you signed with us! Informed that the contract should be null and void due to the numerous violations during the application process, I am currently aware of my rights and the misconduct GM Financial is handling with consumers is erroneous and does need to be investigated. XXXX XXXX did not even attempt to go over the assistance program but instead said take us to court, I know you have already done the research! I responded, You must not be familiar with XXXX XXXX Article XXXX XXXX, I NEED VALIDATION OF DEBT! XXXX XXXX XXXX employed with GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY , INC. attempted to disgrace me and make a joke out of my character, by me exercising my rights. This is the reason we are here today. I do not trust this company to respond without the CFPB involved and GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY , INC. should be following the law and should be held accountable for not following the law. I would also like to point out another fact, my account was not in default when contacting GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY , INC. on XX/XX/2022, XXXX XXXX instead of going over any programs he escalated the call and never mentioned and solutions or remedies. By agent XXXX lying about someone calling me back and no one calling me back after saying someone would and no response from the department manager, CAUSING MORE INJURY PUTTING THIS SAID ACCOUNT IN DEFAULT. I am now requesting GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY , INC. validate the debt and original creditor. Its Federal Law Pursuant to 18 U. S. C. Title 8, that there is no debt present. I need the debt validated and I need a written response as I am allowing this company to indeed cure this situation before I take any legal action and I WILL be taking legal action. If the debt can not be validated I need my title and the lien released as well as any debt removed indefinitely AND the credit balance refund amount that I requested in my initial contact letter. I also would like to include that before I was not aware of my rights with GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY , INC. and I am very aware now. During the contract signing I was not made aware of 15 USC 1605 I was not to be charged a down payment on my property. TRUTH AND LENDING ACT also backs this same law and GM financial allowed XXXX XXXX finance manager to sit there and add insult to injury by being deceptive and misleading. GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL , INCXXXX non-communication is in agreement to owing the refund.',\n",
       "       'I am tired of the run around from XXXX XXXX in trying to come out of forbearance ( via the XXXX XXXX ) which has been ongoing now for the last XXXX months. Where to begin? I was told up front I\\'d be able to enter a deferral plan upon exiting forbearance only to be told other-wise. I then subsequently wasted MONTHS on XXXX loan modification requests which were both denied. Now there has been mis-representation on who actually owns my Note which has led me to believe there are greater mechanisms occurring in an attempt to foreclose on my home. Per the attachment, after asking several times, XXXX XXXX informed me that XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) holds my mortgage Note. However, I spoke to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and they told me that they DO NOT OWN MY MORTGAGE NOTE AND HAVENT SINCE XX/XX/XXXX. You can call XXXX ; ( then select Option # XXXX ) to verify this information. This therefore begs the question : Why would XXXX XXXX send me a letter fraudulently stating otherwise? ( again, defer to attached ) Now I most recently received a letter stating that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Series XXXX owns my Note. Yet its the exact same contact information per the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. WHY CAN I NOT OBTAIN THEIR DIRECT PHONE NUMBER ASIDE FORM A FAKE, GENERIC MAILING ADDRESS? \\nXXXX XXXX NEEDS TO ADVISE ME WHO OWNS MY LOAN NOTE IMMEDIATELY ALONG WITH THEIR PHONE CONTACT INFORMATION OR I WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PURUSE LEGAL ACTION ON THIS MATTER DUE TO THE FOLLOWING REASONS : 1 ) Mis-representing the owner of my Note ( for YEARS ) as being XXXX XXXX . 2 ) Not allowing me a deferral option post-forbearance after being told otherwise up front. All XXXXm repeatedly told is Deferral is not allowed. \\'\\' SAYS WHO???? I would like to hear it directly from this mysterious owner and/or investor of my Note.\\n\\n3 ) Not allowing me to take a loan modification either : I was asked UP FRONT if Id accept a higher payment for the 2nd loan modification request. After saying Yes and then waiting for XXXX months, I was told my loan modification request was denied because the payment couldnt be LOWERED. Really?? Why ask me then if Im ok with a higher payment up front if it was already known raising the payment wasnt even an option for a loan modification? I was never advised by any of the many representatives I spoke to for either of my loan modification requests, that approval was based on the presumption of a lower monthly payment.\\n\\n4 ) The imposter investor named XXXX? Last time I called, I was told by the representative XXXX was the investor holding my Note whom allegedly does not allow deferral options. Interestingly, I can not find any company by that name. I AM TIRED OF THE LIES, MIS-INFORMATION AND RUN AROUND. I AM READY AND ABLE TO RESUME MY MORTGAGE PAYMENTS BUT XXXX XXXX HAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE IN MY MANY ATTEMPTS TO DO SO AFTER MIS-LEADING ME UP FRONT. I feel that at this point, due to all of the mis-information, confusion and their unwillingness to offer any assistance except to tell me verbatim \" Sell your house \\'\\' or \" Get a 2nd job \\'\\' that I have no recourse but to pursue legal remediation. I am beyond exasparated at this point as to how things have gone thus far and hence, the reason I am filing this complaint. \\n\\nFEEDBACK FOR RESOLUTION 1 ) What is the phone number for this entity? Again, I called XXXX XXXX and I sure couldnt speak to anyone from this entity. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Series XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, VA XXXX \\'\\' XXXX ) Why am I unable to contact the investor / owner of my Note directly? \\n\\n3 ) Why did XXXX XXXX ignore my original question of why does a loan modification presume a lower payment amount? When in fact, they asked me up front prior to my 2nd loan modification request if I would be ok with a higher payment? Again -- can I request a loan modification even if it\\'s for a reasonably higher amount? \\n\\n4 ) Lastly, I still do not have a clear answer or proof that the investor or owner of my Note does NOT allow the deferral of my forbearance amount ... which essentially doubled because I had to wait another 7 months for them to tell me it was declined and during said period they told me not to make any payments. If I knew who my actual investor was, I could contact them directly to confirm this information.'],\n",

       "I have been harassed by and on behalf on World Acceptance Corporation every 2-3 years for nearly 6 years.

I contacted all three major credit bureau and they removed the negative information, however this year they started to received and report negative information on the same account. \\nI want all three credit bureau to stop and remove the negative information from my credit profile, this is affecting me in every aspect of my life and want the credit bureau to remove the lateness reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX.I am disputing the charges because i did not made them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
       "I have tried multiple times to correct the balance/status that XXXX XXXX is showing on my credit report with Experian, This house was sold and paid in full XX/XX/XXXX. \\nExperian is showing the status as \" Open/Never late. Deferred, payments begin XX/XX/XXXX '' with an outstanding balance of {$220000.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX. Neither of this is correct! \\nI filed for bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX and the house was never reaffirmed so amount should have been changed to XXXX back then, but it was sold anyway on XX/XX/XXXX which also should have made this balance XXXX! This account is no longer open and payments are not due in XX/XX/XXXX?? This needs to be corrected immediatley, this is ridiculous! \\n\\nI've attached what I could from my XXXX XXXX account showing it is paid in full and balance is XXXX.

       "I am tired of the run around from XXXX XXXX in trying to come out of forbearance ( via the XXXX XXXX ) which has been ongoing now for the last XXXX months. Where to begin? I was told up front I'd be able to enter a deferral plan upon exiting forbearance only to be told other-wise. I then subsequently wasted MONTHS on XXXX loan modification requests which were both denied. Now there has been mis-representation on who actually owns my Note which has led me to believe there are greater mechanisms occurring in an attempt to foreclose on my home. Per the attachment, after asking several times, XXXX XXXX informed me that XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) holds my mortgage Note. However, I spoke to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and they told me that they DO NOT OWN MY MORTGAGE NOTE AND HAVENT SINCE XX/XX/XXXX. You can call XXXX ; ( then select Option # XXXX ) to verify this information. This therefore begs the question : Why would XXXX XXXX send me a letter fraudulently stating otherwise? ( again, defer to attached ) Now I most recently received a letter stating that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Series XXXX owns my Note. Yet its the exact same contact information per the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. WHY CAN I NOT OBTAIN THEIR DIRECT PHONE NUMBER ASIDE FORM A FAKE, GENERIC MAILING ADDRESS? \\nXXXX XXXX NEEDS TO ADVISE ME WHO OWNS MY LOAN NOTE IMMEDIATELY ALONG WITH THEIR PHONE CONTACT INFORMATION OR I WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PURUSE LEGAL ACTION ON THIS MATTER DUE TO THE FOLLOWING REASONS : 1 ) Mis-representing the owner of my Note ( for YEARS ) as being XXXX XXXX . 2 ) Not allowing me a deferral option post-forbearance after being told otherwise up front. All XXXXm repeatedly told is Deferral is not allowed. '' SAYS WHO???? I would like to hear it directly from this mysterious owner and/or investor of my Note.\\n\\n3 ) Not allowing me to take a loan modification either : I was asked UP FRONT if Id accept a higher payment for the 2nd loan modification request. After saying Yes and then waiting for XXXX months, I was told my loan modification request was denied because the payment couldnt be LOWERED. Really?? Why ask me then if Im ok with a higher payment up front if it was already known raising the payment wasnt even an option for a loan modification? I was never advised by any of the many representatives I spoke to for either of my loan modification requests, that approval was based on the presumption of a lower monthly payment.\\n\\n4 ) The imposter investor named XXXX? Last time I called, I was told by the representative XXXX was the investor holding my Note whom allegedly does not allow deferral options. Interestingly, I can not find any company by that name. I AM TIRED OF THE LIES, MIS-INFORMATION AND RUN AROUND. I AM READY AND ABLE TO RESUME MY MORTGAGE PAYMENTS BUT XXXX XXXX HAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE IN MY MANY ATTEMPTS TO DO SO AFTER MIS-LEADING ME UP FRONT. I feel that at this point, due to all of the mis-information, confusion and their unwillingness to offer any assistance except to tell me verbatim \" Sell your house '' or \" Get a 2nd job '' that I have no recourse but to pursue legal remediation. I am beyond exasparated at this point as to how things have gone thus far and hence, the reason I am filing this complaint. \\n\\nFEEDBACK FOR RESOLUTION 1 ) What is the phone number for this entity? Again, I called XXXX XXXX and I sure couldnt speak to anyone from this entity. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Series XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, VA XXXX '' XXXX ) Why am I unable to contact the investor / owner of my Note directly? \\n\\n3 ) Why did XXXX XXXX ignore my original question of why does a loan modification presume a lower payment amount? When in fact, they asked me up front prior to my 2nd loan modification request if I would be ok with a higher payment? Again -- can I request a loan modification even if it's for a reasonably higher amount? \\n\\n4 ) Lastly, I still do not have a clear answer or proof that the investor or owner of my Note does NOT allow the deferral of my forbearance amount ... which essentially doubled because I had to wait another 7 months for them to tell me it was declined and during said period they told me not to make any payments. If I knew who my actual investor was, I could contact them directly to confirm this information.       1\n",
